        <h1>Welcome to PokéMarch Madness :)</h1>
        <h2>It's like March Madness, but better (at least I think so)</h2>
        <p>Every year, my friends and I take a theme or concept related to Pokémon and turn it into a series of brackets. Over the course of March(ish), we each go through and fill out each bracket for the year, recording videos of the process as we go.</p>
        <p>Unlike March Madness, there is no right or wrong result. It's all subjective and meant only as a quirky little way for us to have some fun by sharing our opinions on random (and occasionally goofy) stuff from a franchise that lives rent-free in way too many of our heads.</p>
        <p>Also, please note that this site is still under development. All the basic functionality and necessary features are there and working as intended, but there are still some additional things I'd like to add.</p>
